### Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm Elliott Zheng, a researcher and open source enthusiast from China.

- 🔄 Current Focus: Now, my primary focus is on the [OmniSteward](https://github.com/OmniSteward/OmniSteward) project, which is an exciting new venture in the realms of AI and automation.
- 🌱 My research interest lies in Computer Vision and Computer Graphics.
- 🔋 Additional Interests: I am also deeply interested in [AIoT (Artificial Intelligence of Things)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_of_things), and have a passion for embedded development, particularly with the [ESP](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) platform.
